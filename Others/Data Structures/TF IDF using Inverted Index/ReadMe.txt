0-YOU NEED "open-browser" PACKAGE TO VIEW MY PROJECT IN AN EFFICIENT WAY
1- Firstly, inverted index is created using the "inverted <filepath>" function, where filepath is the file location of all the archives used in search engine
2- Secondly, any term is searched using the function "Search <query>" where query is the string that is used to search
3- Result is returned sorted according to its TF-IDF score


--This is the basic implementation of the search engine. In order to add extra lights to this project, I can further save the index in xml file that would allow greater flexibility, and can retrieve in browser.

--The wikipedia dumps were taking alot of time in downloading, thats why i am submitting it with basic text dump files. the inverted index is already created for few files in "archive" folder. it can be recreated for "sample" folder if needed
